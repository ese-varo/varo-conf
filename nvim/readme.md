## NVIM setup
This are my nvim personal settings, if you want to use this file be sure to first
follow the steps in the requirements section.

#### Requirements
- I use the vim-plug as the plugin manager, install it following the instructions
in the their [documentation](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- Install [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
- I'm using the devicons plugin. In order to enable the icons you should install
a patched font. You can use one of the fonts available at [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- Run this command to reload the editor and install the plugins: `nvim +PlugInstall`

After it you should be good to go.
